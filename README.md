# Overview

This is an experiment with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), which is quickly
becoming my favourite web programming language. Using the `elm-lang/navigation`
library for pseudo-routing, this is a SPA (Single Page Application) which
interfaces with the REST API at
[blogserver](https://github.com/ashutoshrishi/blogserver) to serve as a
front-end for my personal blog.
